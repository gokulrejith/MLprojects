Pick the mint leaves off the stems; discard the stems. Roughly chop the cilantro. Julienne all the veggies and tofu/paneer.If you like, you can sprinkle some salt and pepper on the carrots, cucumbers and bell peppers and mix gently; I avoided them as I love the freshness and taste of these raw vegetables.Now, to prepare the tofu/paneer stuffing, in a mixing bowl, mix tofu/paneer strips with soy sauce, chilli flakes and salt to taste (only if adding). Marinate for about 10 to 15 minutes. Meanwhile when the tofu/paneer is marinating, you can proceed with making the peanut dipping sauce and keep it ready to serve with the spring rolls.Once the tofu/paneer is marinated, in a small nonstick saucepan, heat a teaspoon of oil.Add marinated tofu/paneer. Stir fry on high heat for 1 to 2 minutes. Take care not to break the tofu/paneer strips. Remove from heat and let it cool. This high heat stir fry/ searing helps in bringing in a smoky flavour to the absorbed spices.To assemble the rolls:Work with one rice paper at a time. Soften the rice paper sheet according to the instructions on the packet. (The rice paper I used just needed to be dipped in water for about 20 to 25 seconds, and then placed on a towel to drain excess water). You will want them soft but still firm and pliable.Place the wet sheet on a flat plate or chopping board.Gently place few strips of carrots, bell pepper, cucumbers, a small tablespoon of cilantro and some mint leaves in the center of the wet rice paper sheet.Place a few strips of stir fried marinated tofu/paneer along with the veggies. (Do not over fill since it will be difficult to make rolls)Now, the bring sides over to the center over the filling. Next, starting from the bottom, bring up and start rolling to bring them to rolls.Roll up the filled rice paper to form a cylindrical roll; like a burrito. Seal the edges; the rice paper will instantly stick as it is moist. You want a fairly tight roll so that the vegetable fillings do not fall out.Continue doing the same with rest of the rice paper sheets. (While you are working with each roll, cover the prepared rolls with a wet cloth).To make the peanut dipping sauce:In a small bowl, mix peanut butter, soy sauce, chilli sauce/sriracha sauce along with the lemon juice.Adjust the chilli sauce and lime juice to suit your taste.Whisk in 2 to 3 tablespoons of warm water until you get the desired consistency of dipping. Garnish with crushed peanuts and keep it aside till the spring rolls are ready.Serve Vietnamese Style Vegetarian Spring Rolls Recipe With Peanut Dipping Sauce for a light dinner along with a hearty soup like Fennel Turmeric Walnut Soup With Apple And Raw Mango Recipe or Cream of Mushroom & Spring Onion Soup Recipe.

Soften the rice paper sheet according to the instructions on the packet. (The rice paper I used just needed to be dipped in water for about 20 to 25 seconds, and then placed on a towel to drain excess water). You will want them soft but still firm and pliable.Place the wet sheet on a flat plate or chopping board.Gently place few strips of carrots, bell pepper, cucumbers, a small tablespoon of cilantro and some mint leaves in the center of the wet rice paper sheet.Place a few strips of stir fried marinated tofu/paneer along with the veggies. (Do not over fill since it will be difficult to make rolls)Now, the bring sides over to the center over the filling. Next, starting from the bottom, bring up and start rolling to bring them to rolls.Roll up the filled rice paper to form a cylindrical roll; like a burrito. Seal the edges; the rice paper will instantly stick as it is moist. You want a fairly tight roll so that the vegetable fillings do not fall out.Continue doing the same with rest of the rice paper sheets. (While you are working with each roll, cover the prepared rolls with a wet cloth).To make the peanut dipping sauce:In a small bowl, mix peanut butter, soy sauce, chilli sauce/sriracha sauce along with the lemon juice.Adjust the chilli sauce and lime juice to suit your taste.Whisk in 2 to 3 tablespoons of warm water until you get the desired consistency of dipping. Garnish with crushed peanuts and keep it aside till the spring rolls are ready.Serve Vietnamese Style Vegetarian Spring Rolls Recipe With Peanut Dipping Sauce for a light dinner along with a hearty soup like Fennel Turmeric Walnut Soup With Apple And Raw Mango Recipe or Cream of Mushroom & Spring Onion Soup Recipe.

Ensure the masoor dal is soaked for at least couple of hours. This helps in faster cooking of the red lentil.Pressure cook the soaked masoor dal with 1 cup of water and pressure cook for at least 5 to 6 whistles. Once done, allow the pressure to release naturally.Once the pressure releases, drain out any excess water and keep aside. We can use this water to adjust the consistency of the red lentil hummus later.Cut eggplant lengthwise in half. Scoop out centres flesh of the eggplant, leaving 1/4-inch-thick pulp around the shell.Sprinkle salt and pepper on the eggplant shell and keep it aside in a colander. This will moisten the eggplant and make it sweat a little before it goes into the oven. Let the eggplant rest for about 10 minutes.Chop the eggplant pulp that we removed and keep aside. We will be adding this to the Lentil Hummus mixture.Pre heat the oven to 180 degree Celsius for 10 minutes and keep it ready.Heat oil in a pan over medium heat; add the carrots, sprinkle a little salt.

This is now the red lentil hummus.Stir in a tablespoon of olive oil into the red lentil hummus. Give it a taste and adjust the salt and seasonings according to taste.Now the final step is to bake the eggplant. Cut strips of a foil large enough to hold one eggplant half. We will be using the foil to wrap the eggplant. Place the eggplant halves on centre of each of the foils and fill it with the red lentil hummus. Loosely wrap the eggplant with the foil ensuring it is not tight, and there is enough circulation to steam cook the eggplant.Grill the Stuffed Eggplant for about 20 minutes until the eggplant shells are soft. Once done, you can open the foil and optionally sprinkle parmesan cheese and bake it open until the cheese melts just a bit.Once done, remove from the oven and place the baked eggplants on a serving platter. While the eggplant is baking in the oven, we can make the crumble and the garlic yogurt.To make the CrumbleMake a coarse powder of the walnuts and the almonds and keep aside.Heat a skillet, add a tablespoon of butter, add in chopped garlic and saute till they soften.Add in chopped onions, saute well till the onions have caramelised and changed colour to dark brown.Add in ground nuts and keep toasting the nuts for few minutes.

Gently prick each of them with a toothpick so that they resemble a lollipop. Serve Healthy Veg Lollipop Recipe With Palak & Rajma along with Dhaniya Pudina Chutney and Masala Chai for your tea party or as an evening snack.
","To begin making the Healthy Veg Lollipop Recipe With Palak & Rajma, soak rajma in water for 7-8 hours or overnight. The quantity of rajma would have almost doubled.Drain the water and pressure cook the soaked rajma with fresh water upto 8 to 10 whistles/ about 30 minutes so that they are soft when pressed. Let the pressure release on its own.Drain the water from the rajma and use it for any other purpose (in a curry or to knead chapati dough). Do not discard this water.In the meantime, thoroughly wash palak leaves multiple times. Saute the spinach lighty in a pan without any oil until soft and the spinach shrinks. Turn off the heat and allow the spinach to cool.Now, finely powder rolled oats in a mixer/blender and set aside.In a mixing bowl, take cooked rajma and mash it well using a masher or with your hand. Do not make it completely smooth, but coarsely mash some of them. This will give you a nice texture when you bite the lollipops.Next, add the cooked spinach, oats powder, salt and all the spices mentioned under 'To make Palak Rajma Oats Lollipop' which includes red chilli powder, garam masala powder, cumin powder, amchur powder, salt and oil.Mix all the contents thoroughly so that it forms a soft non-sticky dough. You should be easily able to shape it into small balls. If your dough is sticky, you can add more oats powder. Make small lemon sized balls and set aside.Check the spices and salt and adjust to suit your taste.Now, you will have to make a thin paste of gram flour. For this, mix gram flour with salt and turmeric powder. Add water as required and whisk well to form a lump-free, thin paste. Set aside.Next, make a coarse powder of rolled oats and set aside. Coating the veg lollipops with oats gives a nice crunchy texture to them. Now, heat a paddu / appe / paniyaram pan and add few drops of oil to each of the cavities.Dip each of the veg lollipop balls in gram flour mixture and roll them gently over oats so that they are uniformly coated.Gently place the veg lollipop balls inside the oiled cavities of the paddu pan. Cook them in low-medium heat until light brown in colour. Flip the veg lollipops around so that they cook well on all sides.Once the veg lollipops they are done, transfer them onto a paper towel to remove excess oil.
